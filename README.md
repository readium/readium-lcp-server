Readium LCP Server
==================

Documentation
============
As a retailer, public library or specialized e-distributor, you are distributing EPUB or PDF ebooks, LPF or RPF packaged audiobooks or comics. You want them protected by the Readium LCP DRM. Your CMS (Content Management system) already handles publications, users, purchases or loans, your technical team is able to integrate this CMS with a License server by creating a new endpoint in the CMS and requesting the License Server via its REST interface. If you are in this situation, this open-source codebase is made for you. 

Using the Readium LCP Server you can:
* Encrypt your entire catalog of publications and store these encrypted files in a file system or S3 bucket, ready for download from any LCP compliant reading application;
* Generate LCP licenses and get up-to-date licenses;
* Let users request a loan extension or an early return;
* Cancel a license in case a user has declared he wasn't able to use it;
* Revoke a license in case of oversharing. 
 
**A detailed documentation is found in the [Wiki pages of the project](../../wiki). You really have to read it before you start testing this application.**

Prerequisites
=============

Binaries are not yet pre-built, so you need to get a working Golang installation. 
Please refer to the official GO documentation for installation procedures at https://golang.org/.

This software is working with *go 1.13* or higher.

The servers require the setup of an SQL Database. 

- SQLite is sufficient for most needs. If the "database" property of each server defines a sqlite3 driver, the db setup is dynamically achieved when the server runs for the first time. SQLite database creation scripts are provided in the "dbmodel" folder in case they are useful. 
- MySQL database creation scripts are provided as well in the "dbmodel" folder. These scripts should be applied before launching the servers for the first time. 

We expect other drivers (PostgresQL ...) to be provided by the community. Some implementers have deployed MS SQL Server, but the corresponding scripts were not provided so far. More db connectors will be provided in a future major revision of the application. 

Your platform must be able to handle:

1/ the License Server, active in your intranet, not accessible from the Web, only accessible from your CMS via a REST API. 

2/ the License Status Server, accessible from the Web via a REST API.

3/ a large storage volume for encrypted publications (file system or S3 bucket), accessible from the Web via HTTP URLs. Note that publications are encrypted once: every license generated for such publication is pointing at the same encrypted file. Because these publications are stronlgy encrypted and the decryption key is secured in your SQL database, public access to these files is not problematic.   

Encryption Profiles
===================
Out of the box, this open-source software is using what we call the "basic" LCP profile, i.e. a testing mode provided by the [LCP open standard](https://readium.org/lcp-specs/). Licenses generated with this "basic" profile are perfectly handled by reading applications based on [Readium Mobile](https://www.edrlab.org/software/readium-mobile/), as well as by [Thorium Reader](https://www.edrlab.org/software/thorium-reader/).

But this profile, because it is open, does not offer any security. Security is provided by a "production" profile, i.e. confidential crypto information and a personal X.509 certificate delivered to trusted implementers by [EDRLab](mailto:contact@edrlab.org), the wordwide LCP Certificcation Authority. Licenses generated with the "production" profile are handled by any LCP compliant Reading System.

Executables
===========
The server software is composed of several independant parts:

## [lcpencrypt]  

A command line utility for content encryption. This utility can be included in any processing pipeline. 

lcpencrypt can:
* Take an unprotected publication as input and generates an encrypted file as output
* Optionally, store the encrypted file into a file system or S3 bucket
* Notifie the License server of the generation of the encrypted file

## [lcpserver]

A License server implements [Readium Licensed Content Protection 1.0](https://readium.org/lcp-specs/releases/lcp/latest).

Private functionalities (authentication required) are:
* Store the data resulting from an external encryption, if the encryption utility did not already store it
* Generate a license or returns an up-to-date license
* Generate a protected publication (i.e. an encrypted publication in which a license is embedded)
* Update the rights associated with a license
* Get a set of licenses
* Get a license

## [lsdserver]

A License Status server implements [Readium License Status Document 1.0](https://readium.org/lcp-specs/releases/lsd/latest).

Public functionalities (accessible from the web) are:
* Return a license status document
* Process a device registration request
* Process a lending return request
* Process a lending renewal request

Private functionalities (authentication required) are:
* Be notified of the generation of a new license
* Filter licenses by count of registered devices
* List all registered devices for a given licence
* Revoke or cancel a license

## [frontend]

A Test Frontend server is also provided, which mimics your own CMS, with a GUI and its own REST API. Its sole goal is to help you test the License and License Status servers. It should never be used in production.  

Public functionalities (accessible from the web) are:
* Fetch a license from its id
* Fetch a licensed publication from the license id


Install
=======

Assuming a working Go installation ...

On Linux and MacOS:

If you want to use the master branch:
```sh
# from the go workspace
cd $GOPATH
# fetch, build and install the different packages and their dependencies
go get -v github.com/readium/readium-lcp-server/...
```

Warning: Go has a funny 3-dots syntax, and you really have to type "/..." at the end of the line. 

You should now find the generated Go binaries in $GOPATH/bin: 

- `lcpencrypt`: the command line encryption tool,
- `lcpserver`: the license server,
- `lsdserver`: the status document server,
- `frontend`: a test application (Test Frontend Server) which mimics your content management system. 

Alternatively, if you want to use a feature branch:
```sh
# from the go workspace
cd $GOPATH
# clone the repo, selecting the feature/F branch
git clone -b <feature-branch> https://github.com/readium/readium-lcp-server.git src/github.com/readium/readium-lcp-server
# then fetch, build and install the different packages and their dependencies
go get -v github.com/readium/readium-lcp-server/...
````

You may prefer to install only some of the executables. 
In such a case, the "go get" command should be called once for each package, e.g. for the lcpserver from the master branch:
```sh
cd $GOPATH
go get -v github.com/readium/readium-lcp-server/lcpserver
```

To install properly the Test Frontend Server, you must also install several npm packages.

Note: use a modern version of npm, e.g. npm 6.12.0 or higher. 

To install the npm packages, type:
```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/readium/readium-lcp-server/frontend/manage
npm install
````

On Windows 10:

You must first install a GCC compiler in order to compile the SQLite module and to move later to "production mode". [TDM-GCC](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download) gives great results. 

Also, in the previous instructions, replace: 

* $GOPATH with %GOPATH%
* forward slashes with backslashes in paths.

Configuration
==============

## Environment variables

The server is controlled by a yaml configuration file (e.g. "config.yaml") stored in a convenient folder, eg. `/usr/local/var/lcp`.  

The License Server, License Status Server and Frontend test server will search their configuration file in the go bin directory by default; but the path to the file should be changed using an environment variable:

* `READIUM_LCPSERVER_CONFIG` for the License server
* `READIUM_LSDSERVER_CONFIG` for the License Status server
* `READIUM_FRONTEND_CONFIG` for the Frontend test server

The value of the each global variable is an absolute path to the configuration file for the given server. The three servers may share the same configuration file (useful if they are executed on the same server) or each server may get its own configuration file; this is your choice. 

## Password file

The LCP and LSD servers also require authenticated API requests for some of their functionalities. A password file formatted as an Apache "htpasswd" file is used for such authentication data. The htpasswd file format is of the form:

```sh
	User:$apr1$OMWGq53X$Qf17b.ezwEM947Vrr/oTh0
```

An example of password file generator is found [here](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/). 

The password file may be shared between the LCP and LSD servers if the same credentials are used for both. The exact location and name of the file have no importance, as it will be referenced from the configuration file; but we recommand to name it `htpasswd` and place this file in the same folder as the configuration file, eg. `/usr/local/var/lcp`.

## Certificate

The LCP server requires an X509 certificate and its associated private key. The exact location and name of these files have no importance, as they will be referenced from the configuration file; but we recommand to keep the file name of the file provided by EDRLAb and place these files in a subfolder of the previous one, eg. `/usr/local/var/lcp/cert`.

A test certificate (`cert-edrlab-test.pem`) and private key (`privkey-edrlab-test.pem`) are provided in the `test/cert` directory of the project. These files are be used as long as the LCP server is configured in test mode (`profile` = `basic`). They are replaced by a provider specific certificate and private key when the server is moved to its production mode. 

## Quick-start configuration

A quick-start configuration meant only for test purposes is available in `test/config.yaml`. This file includes a default configuration for the the LCP, LSD and frontend servers.

1. Create a `<LCP_HOME>` folder, eg. `/usr/local/var/lcp`
2. Copy the `test/config.yaml` file into LCP_HOME 
3. Replace any occurrence of `<LCP_HOME>` in config.yaml with the absolute path to the LCP_HOME folder
4. Setup the `READIUM_*_CONFIG` env variables, which must reference the configuration file
5. Generate a password file and place it into LCP_HOME
6. Create `cert`, `db`, `files/storage` folders in LCP_HOME
7. Copy the test certificate, test private key into the `cert` subfolder of LCP_HOME

## Individual server configurations

Here are the details about the configuration properties of each server. In the samples, replace `<LCP_HOME>` with the absolute path to the folder containing the configuration file, password file, encrypted files, database and certificates.

### License Server

#### profile section
`profile`: value of the LCP profile; allowed values are:
- `basic`: default value, as described in the Readium LCP specification, used for tests only.
- `1.0`: the current production profile, maintained by EDRLab.

#### lcp section
`lcp`: parameters associated with the License Server.
- `host`: the public server hostname, `hostname` by default.
- `port`: the listening port, `8989` by default.
- `public_base_url`: the URL used by the License Status Server and the Frontend Test Server to communicate with this License server; combination of the host and port values on http by default.
- `database`: the URI formatted connection string to the database, `sqlite3://file:lcp.sqlite?cache=shared&mode=rwc` by default. `mysql://login:password@/dbname?parseTime=true` if your using MySQL.
- `auth_file`: mandatory; the path to the password file introduced above. 

#### storage section
This section should be empty if the storage location of encrypted publications is managed by the lcpencrypt utility.
If this section is present and lcpencrypt does not manage the storage, all encrypted publications will be stored in the configured folder or s3 bucket.  

`storage`: parameters related to the storage of encrypted publications.
- `mode` : optional. Possible values are "fs" (default value) and "s3".

If `mode` value is `s3`, the following parameters are expected:
- `bucket` (required): name of the target S3 bucket.
- `region` (optional): name of the target AWS region.

The S3 region and client credentials default to a chain of credential providers, searched in environment variables and shared files. See [Setting up an S3 Storage](https://github.com/readium/readium-lcp-server/wiki/Setting-up-an-S3-storage) for details. 
Alternatively (but this is not recommended!), credentials can be stored in clear in the configuration file:
- `access_id`: value of the AWS access key id.
- `secret`: value of the AWS secret access key.

If `mode` value is NOT `s3`, the following paremeters are expected:
- `filesystem` subsection: parameters related to a file system storage.   
  - `directory`: absolute path of the directory in which all encrypted publications are stored. 
  - `url`: absolute http or https url of the storage volume in which all encrypted publications are stored.

#### certificate section
`certificate`: parameters related to the signature of licenses: 	
- `cert`: the path to provider certificate file (.pem or .crt). It will be inserted in the licenses and used by clients for checking the signature. 
- `private_key`: the path to the private key (.pem) asociated with the certificate. It will be used for signing licenses. 

#### license section
`license`: parameters related to static information to be included in all licenses generated by the License Server:
- `links`: subsection: links that will be included in all licenses. `hint` and `publication` links are required in a Readium LCP license.
  If no such link exists in the partial license passed from the frontend when a new license his requested, 
  these link values will be inserted in the partial license.  
  If no value is present in the configuration file and no value is inserted in the partial license, 
  the License server will reply with a 500 Server Error at license creation.
  The sub-properties of the `links` section are:
  - `status`: required, templated URL; location of the Status Document associated with a License Document.
    The license identifier is inserted via the `{license_id}` variable.
  - `hint`: required; location where a Reading System can redirect a user looking for additional information about the User Passphrase. 
  - `publication`: *deprecated in favor of the storage / filesystem / url parameter*, templated URL; 
    Absolute http or https url of the storage volume in which all encrypted publications are stored.
    The publication identifier is inserted via the `{publication_id}` variable.

#### lsd and lsd_notify_auth section 
`lsd_notify_auth`: authentication parameters used by the License Server for notifying the License Status Server 
of the generation of a new license. The notification endpoint is configured in the `lsd` section.
- `username`: required, authentication username
- `password`: required, authentication password

#### Sample config
Here is a License Server sample config:

```yaml
profile: "basic"
lcp:
    host: "192.168.0.1"
    port: 8989
    public_base_url: "http://192.168.0.1:8989/lcpserver"
    database: "sqlite3://file:/usr/local/var/lcp/db/lcp.sqlite?cache=shared&mode=rwc"
    auth_file: "/usr/local/var/lcp/lcpsv/htpasswd"
storage:
    filesystem:
        directory: "/usr/local/var/lcp/storage"
        url: "https://www.example.net/lcp/files/storage/" 
certificate:
    cert: "/usr/local/var/lcp/cert/cert.pem"
    private_key: "/usr/local/var/lcp/cert/privkey.pem"
license:
    links:
        status: "https://www.example.net/lsdserver/licenses/{license_id}/status"     
        hint: "https://www.example.net/static/lcp_hint.html"
lsd:
    public_base_url:  "http://192.168.0.1:8990"
lsd_notify_auth: 
    username: "adm_username"
    password: "adm_password"

```

### License Status Server

#### lsd section
`lsd`: parameters associated with the License Status Server. 
- `host`: the public server hostname, `hostname` by default.
- `port`: the listening port, `8990` by default.
- `public_base_url`: the URL used by the License Server and the Frontend Test Server to communicate with this License Status Server; combination of the host and port values on http by default.
- `database`: the URI formatted connection string to the database, `sqlite3://file:lsd.sqlite?cache=shared&mode=rwc` by default. `mysql://login:password@/dbname?parseTime=true` if your using MySQL.
- `auth_file`: mandatory; the path to the password file introduced above. 

- `license_link_url`: mandatory; the url template representing the url from which a license can be fetched from the provider's frontend server. This url will be inserted in the 'license' link of every status document. It must be the url of a server acting as a proxy between the user request and the License Server. Such proxy is mandatory, as the License Server  does not possess user information needed to craft a license from its identifier. If the test frontend server is used as a proxy, the url must be of the form "http://<frontend-server-url>/api/v1/licenses/{license_id}" (note the /api/v1 section).

#### license_status section
`license_status`: parameters related to the interactions implemented by the License Status server, if any:
- `renting_days`: maximum number of days allowed for a loan, from the date the loan starts. If set to 0 or absent, no loan renewal is possible. 
- `renew`: boolean; if `true`, the renewal of a loan is possible. 
- `renew_days`: default number of additional days allowed during a renewal.
- `return`: boolean; if `true`, an early return is possible.  
- `register`: boolean; if `true`, registering a device is possible.
- `renew_page_url`: URL; if set, the renew feature is implemented as an HTML page, using this URL. This is mostly useful for testing client applications.

#### lcp_update_auth section 
`lcp_update_auth`: authentication parameters used by the License Status Server for updating a license via the License Server. The notification endpoint is configured in the `lcp` section.
- `username`: mandatory, authentication username
- `password`: mandatory, authentication password

#### Sample config
Here is a License Status Server sample config:

```yaml
lsd:
    host: "192.168.0.1"
    port: 8990
    public_base_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8990"
    database: "sqlite3://file:/usr/local/var/lcp/db/lsd.sqlite?cache=shared&mode=rwc"
    auth_file: "/usr/local/var/lcp/htpasswd"
    license_link_url: "https://www.example.net/lcp/licenses/{license_id}"
license_status:
    register: true
    renew: true
    return: true
    renting_days: 60
    renew_days: 7

lcp:
  public_base_url:  "http://127.0.0.1:8989"
lcp_update_auth: 
    username: "adm_username"
    password: "adm_password"
```

### Frontend Server

#### frontend section
`frontend`: parameters associated with the Test Frontend Server. 
- `host`: the public server hostname, `hostname` by default
- `port`: the listening port, `8991` by default
- `public_base_url`: the URL used by the Frontend node.js software to communicate with this  Frontend Test Server; combination of the host and port values on http by default.
- `database`: the URI formatted connection string to the database, `sqlite3://file:frontend.sqlite?cache=shared&mode=rwc` by default. `mysql://login:password@/dbname?parseTime=true` if your using MySQL.
- `master_repository`: repository where the uploaded EPUB files are stored before encryption. 
- `encrypted_repository`: repository where the encrypted EPUB files are stored after upload. The LCP server must have access to the path declared here, as it will move each encrypted file to its final storage folder on notification of encryption from the Frontend Server. 
- `directory`: the directory containing the client web app; by default $GOPATH/src/github.com/readium/readium-lcp-server/frontend/manage.
- `provider_uri`: provider uri, which will be inserted in all licenses produced via this test frontend.
- `right_print`: allowed number of printed pages, which will be inserted in all licenses produced via this test frontend.
- `right_copy`: allowed number of copied characters, which will be inserted in all licenses produced via this test frontend.

The config file of a Test Frontend Server must also define the following properties: 

#### other required sections
The Test Frontend Server must communicate with the License Server and the License Status Server. This is why it must contain the following sections, with the values defined above. 

`lcp`
- `public_base_url`

`lsd`
- `public_base_url`

`lcp_update_auth`
- `username`
- `password`

`lsd_notify_auth`
- `username`
- `password`

#### Sample config
Here is a Test Frontend Server sample config:

```yaml
frontend:
    host: "192.168.0.1"
    port: 8991
    database: "sqlite3://file:/usr/local/var/lcp/db/frontend.sqlite?cache=shared&mode=rwc"
    master_repository: "/usr/local/var/lcp/files/master"
    encrypted_repository: "/usr/local/var/lcp/files/encrypted"
    provider_uri: "https://www.example.net"
    right_print: 10
    right_copy: 2000

lcp:
  public_base_url:  "http://192.168.0.1:8989"
lsd:
  public_base_url:  "http://192.168.0.1:8990"
lcp_update_auth: 
    username: "adm_username"
    password: "adm_password"
lsd_notify_auth: 
    username: "adm_username"
    password: "adm_password"
```

### And for all servers

`localization` section: parameters related to the localization of the messages sent by all three servers.
- `languages`: array of supported localization languages
- `folder`: point to localization file (a .json)
- `default_language`: default language for localization

NOTE: the localization file names (ex: 'en-US.json, de-DE.json') must match the set of supported localization languages.

NOTE: a CBC / GCM configurable property has been DISABLED, see https://github.com/readium/readium-lcp-server/issues/109
"aes256_cbc_or_gcm": either "GCM" or "CBC" (which is the default value). This is used only for encrypting publication resources, not the content key, not the user key check, not the LCP license fields.

Execution
==========
Each server must be launched in a different context (i.e. a different terminal for local use). If the path to the generated Go binaries ($GOPATH/bin) is properly set, each server can launched from any location:

- `lcpserver`
- `lsdserver`
- `frontend`

After the frontend server has been launched, you can access the server GUI via its base url, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8991

NOTE: even if you deploy the server locally, using 127.0.0.1 is not recommended, as you won't be able to access the modules from e.g. a mobile app. It is much better to use the WiFi IPv4 address of your computer and access the server from a mobile device via WiFi.
