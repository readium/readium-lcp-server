# Replace every occurence of <LCP_SERVER>:<PORT> by the License Server host name or IP address + port.

# Replace every occurence of <GATEWAY> by the License Gateway host name.
# Replace every occurence of <LCP_HOME> by the absolute path to the folder hosting every file associated with the LCP service.
